# Why object oriented programming?
- create "like" things
  - that have the same data shape
  - that have shared behavior

## Create a Toy Class
Create instances of `Toy`
- where each toy has a name
- where each toy can be "played" with

## Parts of a class
- `new` will call constructor
- properties (instance variables)
- methods
  - can be written as function declaration or as arrow function

## Toy Tale Lab: What shared data and behavior did toys need?
- Data: name, imageUrl, id, likes
- woody.render()
- buzz.render()
- woody.like() //would increment woody's likeCount



#### We will NOT be rebuilding this entire lab
- Mix of pseudo-coding and mocking some things
- Don't memorize any of this stuff
   - Absorb the concepts
   - Consider how OO and Front-End "work together"




### React and next steps
- Breaking our UI into re-usable chucks call Components
